# Phased Vision: Memory OS to Automation to System of Record

## Overview

Retain's core asset is a unified, local archive of AI conversations across tools.
The long-term vision is to turn this archive into compounding intelligence:

1. **Personal Memory OS**: eliminate context loss and re-explanation.
2. **Personal Automation**: turn repeatable work into reusable playbooks.
3. **System of Record for AI Work**: version, review, and govern AI workflows.

This document outlines the phases, their value, and their exit criteria.

## Phase 1: Personal Memory OS

**Goal**: Make Retain feel like it "remembers" the user's work in context.

**Value**
- Reduce time lost to re-explaining and re-finding prior work.
- Increase consistency of outputs across AI assistants.

**Core Capabilities**
- Unified ingestion across CLI and web sources.
- Learning extraction (corrections, preferences, positive feedback).
- Contextual recall: surface relevant memories for current tasks.
- Scoped memory (global vs project) with human review.

**Exit Criteria**
- Users report fewer repeated corrections.
- Relevant recall appears reliably for common tasks.
- Memory accuracy is high enough to trust for daily work.

## Phase 2: Personal Automation

**Goal**: Convert recurring workflows into reusable playbooks with feedback loops.

**Value**
- Reuse winning workflows with minimal setup time.
- Standardize output quality while staying personal and local-first.

**Core Capabilities**
- Workflow spotting from repeated task patterns.
- Playbook library with editable steps and inputs.
- Manual-first execution with run logs and feedback.
- Confidence updates, decay, and conflict handling.

**Exit Criteria**
- Users run playbooks weekly for real work.
- Measurable time savings on recurring tasks.
- Feedback loops improve playbook quality over time.

## Phase 3: System of Record for AI Work

**Goal**: Provide a versioned, reviewable, and testable home for AI work assets.

**Value**
- Provenance and reproducibility for AI-driven outputs.
- Governance and quality gates for higher-stakes workflows.

**Core Capabilities**
- Versioning for prompts, policies, and playbooks.
- Behavior diffs and evaluation suites (AI CI).
- Sharing and collaboration (teams, orgs, marketplace).

**Exit Criteria**
- Teams adopt Retain as the source of truth for AI workflows.
- Changes are validated via automated tests and reviews.

## Principles

- Local-first and privacy-respecting by default.
- Human review for memory and automation changes.
- Portable learnings across tools and assistants.
